# Loki Example - Bluetooth for the Android emulator

Loki allows Android developers to use Bluetooth in the Android emulator that ships with Android Studio by emulating Bluetooth over TCP/IP. Loki consists of a web-service and an example-app. The example-app is licensed as open-source under the GPL version 3.

The original version was written by Francesco Zanitti, who [published it here on GitHub](https://github.com/cheng81/Android-Bluetooth-Simulator/). However, most of the original code has been replaced or rewritten by now.

*LOKI package is still an alpha! Its core functionality has been tested and is working, but there could still be undiscovered bugs. Also breaking interface changes are likely to happen, so it is not recommended to use it in production projects, yet.*
