# Loki - Bluetooth for the Android emulator

Loki allows Android developers to use Bluetooth in the Android emulator that ships with Android Studio by emulating Bluetooth over TCP/IP. Loki consists of a web-service and an example-app. The example-app is licensed as open-source under the GPL version 3.

*Loki is still an alpha! Its core functionality has been tested and is working, but there are still some parts of the core Bluetooth API missing. Apart from that there could still be undiscovered bugs and breaking interface changes are likely to happen, so it is not recommended to use it in production projects, yet.*

## Contributions

The original version was written by Francesco Zanitti, who [published it on GitHub](https://github.com/cheng81/Android-Bluetooth-Simulator/). However, his repo seems to be abandoned since 2010 and most of the original code has been replaced or rewritten by now.
